# Change Jar

Use Change Jar to plan your monthly budget, track your expenses, and make savings goals. 

You can test it out by heading to https://change-jar.jbroderick9729.now.sh/register, registering, and logging in using those credentials.

Start by entering you income, creating budget categories, and divying your income up among them. Click on Enter Expenses to record them against the appropriate budget categories. 

Known bug: currently you need to refresh to see updates take effect. I hope to fix this very soon.

Coming soon: Money leftover in a category will rollover into next months category. Use this feature to build savings goals without any extra effort. (For example, $30/mo allotted to a "Vet bills" category means every month Fido is healthy, you've saved $30 and will have the cash should anything happen. But don't worry nothing will. Fido will live forever. üê∂)
